Data coverage:
loads of 20 zones
temperature of 11 stations

history ranges from the 1st hour of 2004/1/1 to the 6th hour of 2008/6/30.


Given actual temperature history, the 8 weeks below in the load history are set to be missing and are required to be backcasted.
It's OK to use the entire history to backcast these 8 weeks, and temperature data for these periods are available.
2005/3/6 - 2005/3/12;
2005/6/20 - 2005/6/26;
2005/9/10 - 2005/9/16;
2005/12/25 - 2005/12/31;
2006/2/13 - 2006/2/19;
2006/5/25 - 2006/5/31;
2006/8/2 - 2006/8/8;
2006/11/22 - 2006/11/28;

In addition, the particpants need to forecast hourly loads from 2008/7/1 to 2008/7/7, for which temperature data is NOT available.

Actuals for all of the above periods have now been provided in solution data, so are available to use in scoring performance of forecasts/backcasts.
