THINGS WE NEED TO COVER
1) clear description of your systems/algorithms
2) Motivations of design choices
3) Sensible manipulation of the data
   AND new findings/conclusions from our analysis
4) Appropriat choice of evaluation measures


TIME SERIES PROJECT
How to identify patterns in time series is critical for many businesses including finance and e-commerce
 - This project aims to implement and test various time series techniques for forecasting. Possible topics:
 - Using deep learning & neural networks reading1, reading2, reading3 - Using regression. reading1, reading2
 - Datasets: Energy dataset; Climate data; UCI â€¢ Analyse and report your results:

1) review related work and provide a solution (existing or new)
2) properly evaluate using suitable metrics
3) write a clear manual, report, and upload the code to github with a clear indication for IRDM 2016 group project at UCL

REGIONAL DATA - A hierarchical load forecasting problem
20 energy usage zones
11 weather stations (locations unknown relative to zones)

Observations
patterns amongst zones can be different.
Different customer classes exist (residential, business, industry).
Different responses to temperature / day of week / time of day / season
Electricity provider can also transfer load from one zone to another, on either a short term or long term basis.

Issues
missing data; need to backcast and also forecast.  Can use full history to backcast.
Consider using backcasts to feed back into forecasts?
Can use US holiday data
